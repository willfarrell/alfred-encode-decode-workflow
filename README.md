### macOS Monterey (12.0) compatibility

Starting in macOS Monterey, there won't be any PHP runtime (which is required for this workflow) bundle with the OS, find more info in [#23](https://github.com/willfarrell/alfred-encode-decode-workflow/issues/23).

To Solve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Install Homebrew with the command provided on its [homepage](https://brew.sh/)
2. Install PHP runtime with Homebrew

```shell
brew install php
```

3. Head to setting page of this Alfred workflow, double-click on encode / decode block, and change `php` to `/usr/local/bin/php`, or `/opt/homebrew/bin/php`(if install php by Homebrew).

## Updating
